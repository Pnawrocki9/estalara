# LIVE Properties Section - Fix Summary

## Problem
The admin panel was showing the old "Properties" section instead of the new "LIVE Properties" section, and there were console errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sidebar Navigation Updated
- Changed from "üè† Properties" to "üî¥ LIVE Properties"
- Updated onclick to use `showSection('live-properties')` instead of `showSection('properties')`

### 2. New LIVE Properties Section Added
- Replaced old table-based Properties section with new grid-based LIVE Properties section
- Section ID changed from `properties` to `live-properties`
- Grid layout with `livePropertiesGrid` container
- Polish language labels for better UX

### 3. LIVE Property Modal Added
- New modal with ID `livePropertyModal`
- Two-column layout: form on left, live preview on right
- Real-time preview updates as user types
- Polish language interface
- Form fields: Title, Location, Price, Description, Image URL, Property Link

### 4. JavaScript Integration
- Added `cms.js` script to admin.html (contains all LIVE Properties functions)
- Updated `showSection()` function to call `loadLivePropertiesGrid()` when LIVE Properties section is shown
- Functions from cms.js are now available: `showLivePropertyModal()`, `hideLivePropertyModal()`, `editLiveProperty()`, `deleteLiveProperty()`

### 5. CSS Styles Added
- `.cms-card`, `.cms-btn`, `.cms-btn-primary`, `.cms-btn-secondary`, `.cms-btn-success`, `.cms-btn-danger`
- `.line-clamp-2` for text truncation
- Hover effects and transitions

### 6. Dashboard Updated
- Changed "Manage Properties" card to "Manage LIVE Properties"
- Updated button to link to new `live-properties` section

## Console Messages Explained

The console messages you see are normal and informational:

1. **Tailwind CDN Warning**: This is a development warning from Tailwind CSS CDN. It doesn't affect functionality. For production, you should build Tailwind CSS locally as noted in the HTML comment.

2. **Logo Messages**: These are debug logs from `cms-integration.js` that help track logo loading. They are informational, not errors.

3. **"No logo elements found"**: This happens if the admin page doesn't have logo images with `alt="ESTALARA"`. This is normal for the admin panel and doesn't affect functionality.

## How to Use

1. Open admin.html in your browser
2. Click on "üî¥ LIVE Properties" in the sidebar
3. Click "+ Dodaj Kafelek" to add a new LIVE property
4. Fill in the form and see the live preview update in real-time
5. Click "Zapisz Kafelek" to save

## Data Storage

- LIVE Properties are stored in `localStorage` under key `estalaraAdminData`
- They are stored in the `liveProperties` array
- The data structure is:
  ```javascript
  {
    id: number,
    title: string,
    location: string,
    price: number,
    description: string,
    image: string (URL),
    link: string (URL)
  }
  ```

## Migration Note

The old `properties` array in localStorage is automatically migrated to `liveProperties` when the page loads (handled by cms-integration.js). This ensures backward compatibility with existing data.
