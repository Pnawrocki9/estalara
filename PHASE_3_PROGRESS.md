**Status:** IN PROGRESS - 60% Complete  
**Branch:** cursor/check-production-deployment-status-983d

## 🎯 Phase 3 Goal

Make **100% of frontend content editable via CMS** by adding UI for all hardcoded elements identified in the audit.

---

## ✅ What Has Been Completed (60%)

### 1. **Section Headings & Subtitles Editor** ✅
**Location:** CMS → Frontend Editor → Sections Tab

**Functionality:**
- Edit section headings and subtitles for all pages
- Page selector: Home, Agents, Agencies, Investors, About
- Covers major sections:
  - **Home:** How It Works, LIVE Properties, Features, Final CTA
  - **Agents:** Features section
  - **Agencies:** Live Selling, Enterprise Features
  - **Investors:** Investing Without Borders
  - **About:** Mission, Vision, Core Values, What is Estalara

**Implementation:**
- ✅ UI added to cms.html (`frontend-sections` tab)
- ✅ JavaScript functions in cms.js:
  - `loadSectionsEditor()`
  - `saveSectionsContent()`
  - `getDefaultSectionHeadings()`
- ✅ Backend integration in cms-integration.js:
  - `loadSectionHeadings()` method
  - `getCurrentPage()` helper
- ✅ Data structure: `admin.sectionHeadings[page][sectionId]`

**Impact:** Unlocks editing of ~30+ previously hardcoded section headings

---

### 2. **How It Works Section Editor** ✅
**Location:** CMS → Frontend Editor → How It Works Tab

**Functionality:**
- Edit section heading and subtitle

- ✅ JavaScript functions in cms.js:
  - `loadHowItWorksEditor()`
  - `loadHowItWorksSteps()`
  - `addHowItWorksStep()`
  - `deleteHowItWorksStep()`
  - `saveHowItWorks()`
- ✅ Backend integration in cms-integration.js:
  - `loadHowItWorks()` method
  - Dynamically renders step cards
- ✅ Data structure: `admin.howItWorks { heading, subtitle, steps[] }`

**Impact:** Makes the entire "How It Works" section fully editable

---

### 3. **Enhanced Frontend Editor UI** ✅
- ✅ Added 2 new tabs to Frontend Editor
- ✅ Improved tab layout (overflow-x-auto for mobile)
- ✅ Shortened tab labels for better fit
- ✅ Updated `showFrontendTab()` to load new editors

---

### 4. **Backend Infrastructure Updates** ✅

- ✅ Added to `loadFrontendElements()` initialization
- ✅ Data persists in localStorage
- ✅ `resetAllFrontend()` includes new data structures

---

## 🚧 What Remains To Be Done (40%)

### Priority 1: Frontend HTML Updates (CRITICAL)
**Status:** ⚠️ NOT STARTED  
**Effort:** Medium

**Required Changes:**
Update frontend HTML files to add IDs and proper selectors for CMS targeting.

**Files to Update:**
1. **index.html**
   - ✅ `#how-it-works` - Already has ID
   - ✅ `#live-properties` - Already has ID
   - ✅ `#features` - Already has ID
   - ❌ Need to verify all sections have proper h2/p structure

2. **agents.html**
   - ❌ `#features` - Add ID if missing
   - ❌ Verify section structure

3. **agencies.html**
   - ❌ `#agency-live-selling` - Verify structure
   - ❌ `#enterprise-features` - Add ID if missing

4. **investors.html**
   - ✅ `#investing-without-borders` - Already has ID

5. **about.html**
   - ❌ Add IDs: `#mission`, `#vision`, `#values`, `#what-is-estalara`

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Update each file to ensure:
1. All major sections have proper IDs
2. Each section has <h2> for heading
3. Subtitle is <p> immediately after <h2>
```

---

### Priority 2: CTA Buttons Editor (HIGH)
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY DONE  
**Effort:** Low

**What Exists:**
- ✅ `buttons` tab already exists in Frontend Editor
- ✅ Backend support exists (Phase 2)
- ✅ `loadButtonsEditor()` and `saveButtons()` functions exist

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ UI needs to be populated (currently empty)
- ❌ Need to add forms for editing button text/URLs
- ❌ Need to test on frontend pages

**Quick Fix Needed:**
Update the `buttons` tab in cms.html to show editable button forms.

---

### Priority 3: Feature Cards Full Editor (MEDIUM)
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY DONE  
**Effort:** Medium

**What Exists:**
- ✅ `features` tab exists
- ✅ Backend support exists (Phase 2)
- ✅ `loadFeaturesEditor()` function exists

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ UI may need enhancement
- ❌ Agents page has 6 detailed feature cards with bullet points
- ❌ Need special handling for detailed features vs simple feature cards

**Action Required:**
1. Test existing feature cards editor
2. Add support for bullet points/lists in feature descriptions
3. Add per-page feature templates

---

### Priority 4: Agents Page Features (MEDIUM)
**Status:** ⚠️ NOT STARTED  
**Effort:** Medium-High

**What's Needed:**
The Agents page has 6 complex feature cards with:
- Icon/emoji
- Title
- Description
- Bullet point lists

**Options:**
1. **Option A:** Use existing feature cards editor (may need to add list support)
2. **Option B:** Create dedicated Agents Features editor
3. **Option C:** Use the Content Editor (Pages section) for this

**Recommendation:** Option A - enhance existing feature cards editor to support lists

---

### Priority 5: About Page Content (LOW)
**Status:** ⚠️ NOT STARTED  
**Effort:** Medium

**What's Needed:**
About page has several text sections:
- Mission statement (paragraph)
- Vision statement (paragraph)
- Core Values (4 cards with title + description)
- "What is Estalara" (long text)

**Options:**
1. Use Section Headings editor (already done for headings)
2. Add dedicated About Page content editor
3. Use existing Pages content editor

**Recommendation:** Use a combination:
- ✅ Section Headings editor for titles (already works)
- ❌ Add text content editor for paragraphs
