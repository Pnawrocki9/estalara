# HERO Section Fix Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed HOME HERO Title Animation Sequence

**Problem:** Animation was only showing "Go LIVE." → "Go GLOBAL." in a loop.

**Solution:** Updated animation to show the correct sequence:
1. First: "Go LIVE."
2. Then: "Go GLOBAL."
3. Finally: "Go LIVE. Go GLOBAL."

**Files Modified:**
- `main.js` (line 138): Changed Typed.js strings array to `['Go LIVE.', 'Go GLOBAL.', 'Go LIVE. Go GLOBAL.']`

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed Subtitle Flash on Page Load

**Problem:** Hardcoded subtitle was visible for a split second before CMS content loaded.

**Solution:** 
- Hidden subtitle initially with `opacity: 0`
- Made it visible only after CMS loads the content
- Applied to all pages (HOME, Agents, Agencies, Investors, About)

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html`: Hero subtitle now hidden initially
- `agents.html`: Hero subtitle now hidden initially
- `about.html`: Hero subtitle now hidden initially
- `investors.html`: Hero subtitle now hidden initially
- `agencies.html`: Hero subtitle now hidden initially
- `cms-integration-refactored.js`: Sets `opacity: 1` when content loads

---

### 3. ✅ Standardized Hero Font Size Across All Pages

**Problem:** HOME page had larger hero font size than other pages.

**Solution:** Standardized all pages to use the same responsive font size:
- Changed from `clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem)` on HOME
- To `clamp(3rem, 6vw, 5rem)` on all pages (matching subpages)

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html`: Updated `.hero-text` CSS class

---

### 4. ✅ Made HERO Section Editable on Every Subpage

**Problem:** CMS could only edit HOME page hero section.

**Solution:**
- Extended CMS integration to support all pages
- Added default hero content for all pages in content store
- Updated hero loading logic to detect current page and load appropriate content

**Files Modified:**
- `content-store.js`: Added hero sections for all pages:
  - `pages.agents.hero`
  - `pages.agencies.hero`
  - `pages.investors.hero`
  - `pages.about.hero`

- `cms-integration-refactored.js`: Enhanced `loadHero()` method to:
  - Detect current page
  - Load hero content for that specific page
  - Update both title and subtitle
  - Support both animated (HOME) and static (subpages) hero titles

## How to Edit HERO Sections via CMS

All HERO sections can now be edited through the CMS by updating the following structure in Firebase/localStorage:

```json
{
  "pages": {
    "home": {
      "hero": {
        "title": "Custom title for HOME",
        "subtitle": "Custom subtitle",
        "ctaText": "Button text",
        "ctaUrl": "https://url.com"
      }
    },
    "agents": {
      "hero": {
        "title": "Custom title for Agents page",
        "subtitle": "Custom subtitle",
        "ctaText": "Button text",
        "ctaUrl": "https://url.com"
      }
    }
    // ... same structure for agencies, investors, about
  }
}
```

## Technical Details

### Animation Implementation
- Uses Typed.js library for typewriter effect
- HOME page only has animated title
- Subpages have static titles (can be made animated if needed)

### CMS Integration
- Content loaded from: Firebase → localStorage → Defaults
- Changes sync across all tabs via localStorage events
- No flash of unstyled content (FOUC) thanks to opacity transitions

### Font Size Standardization
- All pages now use: `clamp(3rem, 6vw, 5rem)`
- Responsive across all screen sizes
- Maintains consistent visual hierarchy
