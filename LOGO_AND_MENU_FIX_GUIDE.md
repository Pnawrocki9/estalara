# Logo Upload & Mobile Menu Fix Guide

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Logo Upload in CMS ‚úì
**Problem:** There was no way to upload a logo file in the CMS - only a URL field existed.

**Solution:** Added a complete logo upload system with the following features:
- **File Upload Button** - Click "üìÅ Choose Logo File" to select any image file (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.)
- **Automatic Preview** - Logo preview shows immediately after upload
- **Data URL Storage** - Uploaded logos are converted to base64 and stored in localStorage
- **URL Option Still Available** - You can still paste a URL if you prefer

### 2. Mobile Hamburger Menu ‚úì
**Problem:** The hamburger menu wasn't opening on mobile devices.

**Solution:** Fixed the JavaScript toggle functionality to properly show/hide the menu by:
- Adding `flex` class when opening the menu
- Removing `flex` class when closing the menu
- Properly managing the `hidden` class
- Works across all pages: Home, Agents, Agencies, Investors, About
