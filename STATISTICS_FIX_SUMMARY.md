# Statistics CMS Integration Fix

## Problem
Statistics sections in `agents.html` and `about.html` were displaying hardcoded default values instead of values from the CMS.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Inconsistent HTML structure**: Statistics sections had different structures and hardcoded values
2. **Missing normalization**: CMS data structure wasn't properly extracting statistics from top-level
3. **Missing merge fallback**: No check to ensure statistics always exist in content-store

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `agents.html` (Line 326-348)
**Before**: Hardcoded statistics without proper class structure
**After**: 
- Added `.reveal` class to each stat div
- Added `stat-number` class with consistent styling
- Added comment: `<!-- Statistics loaded dynamically from CMS -->`
- Standardized structure to match CMS expectations

### 2. Updated `about.html` (Line 536-564)
**Before**: Different hardcoded statistics (50+ Countries, 25+ Languages, etc.)
**After**:
- Unified statistics structure with agents.html
- Used same default values (500+, 10K+, €2.5B+, 95%)
- Added proper class structure for CMS replacement
- Added comment: `<!-- Statistics loaded dynamically from CMS -->`

### 3. Enhanced `content-store.js` (Lines 120-140, 262-268)
**Changes**:
- Added statistics extraction in `normalizeData()` function:
  ```javascript
  if (Array.isArray(data.statistics)) {
      normalized.statistics = data.statistics;
  }
  ```
- Added statistics fallback in `mergeWithDefaults()`:
  ```javascript
  if (!Array.isArray(result.statistics) || result.statistics.length === 0) {
      result.statistics = this.defaults.statistics;
  }
  ```

### 4. Verified `cms-integration-refactored.js` (Line 445-483)
The `loadStatistics()` function was already correct:
- Properly detects agents.html and about.html
- Finds statistics section with correct selector
- Replaces entire grid content with CMS data
- Re-registers reveal animations

## How It Works Now

1. **CMS Editor** (`cms.html`):
   - Admin edits 4 statistics (number + label)
   - Data saved to localStorage in `admin.statistics` array
   - Data synced to Firebase via the CMS system

2. **Data Flow**:
   ```
   CMS (Firebase/localStorage)
   → ContentStore.normalizeData() → extracts statistics from top-level
   → ContentStore.mergeWithDefaults() → ensures statistics exist
   → EstalaraAdmin.loadStatistics() → replaces HTML content
   → Visible on agents.html and about.html
   ```

3. **Frontend Pages**:
   - On page load, ContentStore loads CMS data
   - EstalaraAdmin.loadUI() calls loadStatistics()
   - Statistics section gets replaced with CMS values
   - Reveal animations are re-registered

## Default Statistics
If CMS has no custom statistics, these defaults are used:
- **500+** Active Agents
- **10K+** Global Investors  
- **€2.5B+** Property Value
- **95%** Close Rate

## Testing
To test that statistics are loading from CMS:
1. Open `cms.html` and login
2. Navigate to Frontend → Statistics tab
3. Edit the statistics values
4. Click "Save Statistics"
5. Open `agents.html` or `about.html`
6. Verify new statistics appear (may need refresh)

## Console Logging
When statistics load successfully, you'll see:
```
✅ Statistics: Loading 4 statistics on agents.html
```

If there's an issue:
```
⚠️ Statistics: Section not found or insufficient data
```

## Files Modified
1. ✅ `agents.html` - Updated statistics section structure
2. ✅ `about.html` - Updated statistics section structure  
3. ✅ `content-store.js` - Added statistics normalization and fallback
4. ✅ `cms-integration-refactored.js` - Verified (already correct)

## Compatibility
- Works with both old and new CMS data structures
- Gracefully falls back to defaults if CMS data unavailable
- Handles Firebase and localStorage data sources
- Responsive on all device sizes
