## üìã Detailed Tasks

### Task 1: Agents Page Features Editor ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY

**Current Gap:**
- Agents page has 6 detailed feature cards
- Each has: icon, title, description, AND bullet list
- Currently 0% editable

**Solution:**
Create dedicated "Agents Features" editor with support for:
- Icon/emoji
- Title
- Description
- Multiple bullet points (add/edit/delete)
- All 6 features fully editable

**Implementation:**
1. Add new tab "Agents Features" to Frontend Editor
2. Create form for editing each of the 6 features
3. Support for bullet list items
4. Save to `admin.agentsFeatures[]`
5. Load in cms-integration.js
6. Update agents.html if needed

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours  
**Impact:** +10% coverage

### Task 2: About Page Content Editor ‚≠ê MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current Gap:**
- Section headings ARE editable (Phase 3)
- Paragraph content is hardcoded
- Mission, Vision, Values paragraphs = 0% editable

**Solution:**
Add editors for:
- Mission paragraph (2 paragraphs)
- Vision paragraph (2 paragraphs)
- "What is Estalara" long description

**Implementation:**
1. Add new tab "About Page Content" to Frontend Editor
2. Create textarea fields for each paragraph
3. Save to `admin.aboutContent{}`
4. Load in cms-integration.js
5. Update about.html with targetable elements

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour  
**Impact:** +5% coverage

### Task 3: Enhance Feature Cards Editor (Optional)

**Current Gap:**
- Feature cards editor exists but may not support lists
- Could be used for Agents page if enhanced

**Solution:**
Add bullet list support to existing feature cards editor:
- Add "description type" selector (text vs list)
- Show bullet list editor when type = list
- Save as array of strings
- Render as <ul> on frontend

**Implementation:**
1. Update feature cards UI in cms.html
2. Add list item add/delete buttons
3. Update save function to handle lists
4. Update load function in cms-integration.js

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour  
**Impact:** Alternative to Task 1
