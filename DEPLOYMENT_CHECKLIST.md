# Netlify Deployment Checklist - Logo Persistence

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes

### 1. Logo Files Optimized
- ‚úÖ Renamed `Estalara Logo.png` to `EstalaraLogo-alt.png` (removed space)
- ‚úÖ Available logo files:
  - `assets/logo.svg` (default)
  - `assets/EstalaraLogo.png`
  - `assets/EstalaraLogo-alt.png`

### 2. CMS Improvements
- ‚úÖ Added clear guidance in both CMS and Admin panels about Netlify deployment
- ‚úÖ Added helpful warnings about logo URL best practices
- ‚úÖ Added validation to warn about spaces in filenames
- ‚úÖ Shows success message when using relative paths like `assets/logo.png`

### 3. Configuration Files
- ‚úÖ Created `netlify.toml` with proper asset caching and deployment settings
- ‚úÖ Created `LOGO_PERSISTENCE_GUIDE.md` with detailed instructions

### 4. Logo Loading System
- ‚úÖ Logo system already supports both methods:
  - File upload (converts to data URL, stored in localStorage)
  - URL path (recommended for Netlify)
- ‚úÖ Logo URL encoding handles spaces properly (though not recommended)
- ‚úÖ Logo updates across all pages via `cms-integration.js`

## üöÄ How to Deploy with Persistent Logo

### Option 1: Use Existing Logo (Recommended)
1. Go to CMS or Admin ‚Üí Settings
2. In "Upload Logo" section, use URL field
3. Enter: `assets/EstalaraLogo.png`
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Refresh your pages to verify
6. Commit and push to git
7. Deploy to Netlify

### Option 2: Add Your Own Logo
1. Place your logo in the `assets/` folder
2. Name it without spaces (e.g., `mylogo.png`)
3. Go to CMS ‚Üí Settings
4. Enter: `assets/mylogo.png`
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Commit and push to git
7. Deploy to Netlify

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Use relative paths: `assets/logo.png`
- ‚úÖ Keep filenames without spaces
- ‚úÖ Commit logo files to git repository
- ‚úÖ Test on Netlify preview before final deployment

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Don't rely on file upload for production (data URLs don't persist across deployments)
- ‚ùå Don't use filenames with spaces
- ‚ùå Don't use absolute URLs to your own domain (causes circular dependency)
- ‚ùå Don't forget to click "Save Changes" in CMS

## üîç Testing Your Logo

Before deploying to Netlify:

1. **Local Test:**
   ```bash
   # Open CMS
   # Go to Settings
   # Set logo URL to: assets/EstalaraLogo.png
   # Save and refresh pages
   ```

2. **Verify localStorage:**
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console (F12)
   const data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('estalaraAdminData'));
   console.log(data.logoUrl);
   // Should show: assets/EstalaraLogo.png or assets/logo.svg
   ```

3. **Check Logo Elements:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   document.querySelectorAll('img[alt="ESTALARA"]').forEach(img => {
     console.log(img.src);
   });
   ```

## üìù Files Modified

1. `assets/Estalara Logo.png` ‚Üí `assets/EstalaraLogo-alt.png`
2. `cms.html` - Added deployment guidance and validation
3. `admin.html` - Added deployment guidance and validation
4. `cms.js` - Added logo URL validation function
5. `netlify.toml` - Created with proper configuration
6. `LOGO_PERSISTENCE_GUIDE.md` - Detailed documentation
7. `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - This file

## üéØ Current Logo Configuration

**Default Logo Path:** `assets/logo.svg`

**How it works:**
1. Logo URL stored in: `localStorage.estalaraAdminData.logoUrl`
2. Loaded by: `cms-integration.js` ‚Üí `updateLogo()` function
3. Applied to: All pages via `EstalaraAdmin` class initialization
4. Updates: All `<img>` elements with `alt="ESTALARA"`

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Logo doesn't show on Netlify
**Solution:** Make sure you're using `assets/logo.png` not a data URL

### Logo URL has %20 characters
**Solution:** Rename file to remove spaces, use hyphens instead

### Changes not persisting
**Solution:** 
- Click "Save Changes" in CMS
- Refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check localStorage isn't being cleared

### Logo different on different devices
**Solution:** If using file upload, switch to URL path method

## ‚ú® Next Steps

1. Review the logo in CMS settings
2. Ensure it's set to a relative path (e.g., `assets/EstalaraLogo.png`)
3. Commit changes to git
4. Push to your repository
5. Deploy to Netlify
6. Verify logo appears on all pages
