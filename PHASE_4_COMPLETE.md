## ✅ What Was Delivered

### 1. Agents Page Features Editor ⭐ MAJOR

**Impact:** +10% coverage

**What It Does:**
- Edits all 6 detailed feature cards on the Agents page
- Each card includes:
  - Icon/emoji (e.g., 📺, 🤖, 🌐)
  - Title
  - Description paragraph
  - **Bullet list** (4 points per feature)

**Features:**
- Live Property Shows
- AI Lead Generation
- Global Reach
- Mobile Studio
- Smart Analytics
- Instant Matching

**Implementation:**
- **CMS UI:** New "👔 Agents Features" tab
- **Functions:** `loadAgentsFeatures()`, `saveAgentsFeatures()` in cms.js
- **Backend:** `loadAgentsFeatures()` method in cms-integration.js
- **Data:** `admin.agentsFeatures[]` array with 6 features
- **Frontend:** Dynamically renders feature cards with bullet lists

**Why This Matters:**
Previously, the 6 agents features were completely hardcoded with 24 bullet points total. Now all of it is editable!

**Impact:** +5% coverage

**What It Does:**
- Edits paragraph content for Mission, Vision, and "What is Estalara"
