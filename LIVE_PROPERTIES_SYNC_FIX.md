# LIVE Properties Synchronization Fix

## Problem
LIVE properties added/edited in the CMS were not appearing on the frontend (`index.html`).

## Root Cause
The CMS (`cms.js`) was saving data to localStorage without preserving the `version` number. When the frontend (`cms-integration.js`) loaded the data, it detected the missing or outdated version and reset everything to defaults, overwriting the CMS changes.

### Technical Details
- Frontend expects `version: 4` in localStorage data
- CMS was not setting/preserving the version when saving
- On page load, frontend code at lines 330-334 in `cms-integration.js` checks:
  ```javascript
  if (!parsed.version || parsed.version < defaultContent.version) {
      loaded = { ...defaultContent }; // RESETS TO DEFAULTS!
  }
  ```

## Solution
Added version preservation to all save operations in:

### 1. `cms.js` - CMS Panel
- Modified `loadAdminData()` to ensure version is always set when loading
- Added version checks before all `localStorage.setItem()` calls:
  - Save LIVE property (add/edit)
  - Delete LIVE property  
  - Save old property (deprecated but still used)
  - Delete old property
  - Save general settings
  - Save platform settings
  - Save page content

### 2. `admin.html` - Admin Panel
- Modified `saveData()` to set version before saving
- Modified `loadData()` to set version when loading
- Added version check before page content save

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Clear Old Data (One-time)
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Run: `localStorage.removeItem('estalaraAdminData')`
4. Refresh the page

### Step 2: Test CMS â†’ Frontend Sync
1. Open `cms.html` in browser
2. Go to "ðŸ”´ LIVE Properties" section
3. Click "Dodaj Kafelek" (Add Tile)
4. Fill in property details:
   - Title: "Test Property from CMS"
   - Location: "Test City, Country"
   - Price: 500000
   - Description: "This is a test property"
   - Image URL: Any image URL
   - Link: https://app.estalara.com/test
5. Click "Zapisz" (Save)
6. Verify the property appears in the CMS grid

### Step 3: Verify Frontend Display
1. Open `index.html` in a NEW TAB (or refresh existing tab)
2. Scroll down to "LIVE Properties" section
3. **VERIFY**: The test property should now appear!

### Step 4: Verify Version in DevTools
1. Open DevTools Console
2. Run: `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('estalaraAdminData')).version`
3. **EXPECTED**: Should show `4`

### Step 5: Test Edit & Delete
1. Go back to `cms.html`
2. Edit the test property (change title)
3. Save and refresh `index.html`
4. **VERIFY**: Changes appear on frontend
5. Delete the test property in CMS
6. Refresh `index.html`
7. **VERIFY**: Property is removed from frontend

## Files Modified
- `cms.js` - 7 save operations fixed
- `admin.html` - 2 save operations fixed

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - LIVE properties should now sync correctly between CMS and frontend.

## Note
If you had properties in the CMS before this fix, you may need to:
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.removeItem('estalaraAdminData')`
2. Refresh both CMS and frontend
3. Re-add your properties in the CMS

The fix ensures all future saves preserve the version number.
