# Logo Save Functionality Fix

## Problem
The "Save Changes" button in the CMS Settings section was not working when trying to save logo settings. Users could enter a logo URL or upload a logo file, but clicking "Save Changes" did nothing.

## Root Cause
The form submit event listener was being attached in the `DOMContentLoaded` event, but there were potential issues with:
1. Event listeners not being properly attached when the Settings section was shown
2. No error handling or debugging information to identify failures
3. Potential conflicts with multiple event listener attachments

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Event Listener Management
- Added `data-listener-attached` flags to prevent duplicate event listeners
- Implemented backup event listener attachment in `loadSettingsForm()` function
- Event listeners are now attached both on page load AND when the Settings section is shown

### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks around `saveGeneralSettings()` function
- Added detailed console logging throughout the save process
- User-friendly error alerts if save fails

### 3. Console Debugging
Added console.log statements to track:
- When event listeners are attached
- When form is submitted
- Form values being saved
- localStorage save operations
- Success/failure of each step

## Changes Made to cms.js

### Modified Functions:
1. **loadSettingsForm()** (lines 76-165)
   - Added backup form submit handler
   - Re-attached logo URL input handler
   - Re-attached logo file upload handler
   - All with duplicate prevention using dataset flags

2. **saveGeneralSettings()** (lines 303-352)
   - Wrapped entire function in try-catch block
   - Added extensive console logging
   - Better error reporting

3. **DOMContentLoaded event handler** (lines 175-277)
   - Added dataset flag after attaching event listeners
   - Enhanced console logging
   - Added warning if form not found

## Testing Instructions

1. Open CMS (cms.html) in browser
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Navigate to Settings section
4. Check Console for these messages:
   - "Form submit handler attached in DOMContentLoaded"
   - "Form submit handler attached in loadSettingsForm"
   
5. Enter a logo URL (e.g., "assets/logo.svg") or upload a file
6. Click "Save Changes"
7. Check Console for:
   - "Form submit event triggered"
   - "saveGeneralSettings called"
   - "Form values: {siteTitle, siteDescription, contactEmail, logoUrl}"
   - "Saving admin data: {...}"
   - "Data saved to localStorage"

8. Verify green notification appears: "Settings saved successfully! Refresh your website pages to see changes."

## How to Verify Fix Works

1. Open browser Console (F12 â†’ Console tab)
2. Enter logo URL: `assets/logo.svg`
3. Click "Save Changes"
4. Check localStorage:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.getItem('estalaraAdminData')
   ```
5. Verify the logoUrl is saved in the returned JSON

## Additional Notes

- All event listeners now have duplicate prevention
- Console logging can be removed once confirmed working in production
- Error handling ensures users see helpful messages if something fails
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
